We are tring to create an app able to create a functioning city with a given number of inhabitants. At this stage the program is working however there is still room for improvement.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Table of contents}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

To install and run our project you first need to install our source code with this command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone git@github.com:loickballoy/CityMap.git}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once that is done you have to make your way to the interface directory, make and run the executable given\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd interface}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{./input\_gtk}

\end{DoxyCode}


This method of installation will soon be improved.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
We use GTK and SDL libraries to create the city. We use methods such as L-\/systems to create this city. Furthermore, to add on to our app, a subway network is created for each city that has a minimum of 2000 inhabitants. If yous wish to create a city with interest points and no subway lines you must enter debug mode and uncomment the main.\+c file in assign directory then execute the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{./main [nbbat] [roof]}

\end{DoxyCode}


this will unfortunately not come with a GUI however the display of matrix is clear and will allow you to understand and modify if wanted this project for personnal usage.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Screenshots}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}

You can now add biases to fit your city necessities. For instance, by increasing the value of the security bias you will obtain a city with more comissaries. Have fun with those biases to obtain different cities!!\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Resources (\+Documentation and other links)}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
To have further documentation on our code execute the following commmand from the source directory\+:
